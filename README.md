## From the CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript website:
"This course picks up where CS50x leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation
of web apps with **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **SQL** using frameworks like **Django**, **React**, and **Bootstrap**.
Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience.
Through hands-on projects, students learn to write and use **APIs**, create interactive **UIs**, and leverage cloud services like **GitHub** and **Heroku**.
By semesterâ€™s end, students emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower them to design and deploy applications on the Internet.
**Prerequisites**
CS50x or prior experience in any programming language."
